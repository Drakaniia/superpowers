# iFlow CLI Installation

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable "skills" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Installation

### iFlow CLI

**Important**: iFlow CLI requires a specific directory structure for skills to be automatically discovered. All skills must be placed directly in `/skills` (not in `/skills/superpowers/`).

The iFlow skills system looks for `SKILL.md` files at the root level of the skills directory (like `skills/canvas-design/SKILL.md`). 

**Follow these installation instructions:**

```bash
# Fetch and follow the installation instructions
curl -o INSTALL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakaniia/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.iflow/INSTALL.md
```

Or manually:

1. **Clone the repository** to your workspace
2. **Copy skills** to your iFlow skills directory:
   - Each skill from `skills/` should go to `YOUR_IFLOW_SKILLS_DIR/skill-name/SKILL.md`
   - Copy `agents/` to your iFlow agents directory
   - Copy `commands/` to your iFlow commands directory
3. **Copy hooks** if you want to use session-start functionality:
   - Copy `hooks/session-start` to your iFlow hooks directory
   - Copy `hooks/hooks.json` to your iFlow hooks directory

**To update:**

```bash
cd YOUR_CLONE_LOCATION
git pull
# Copy updated skills, agents, commands to your iFlow directories
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new iFlow CLI session and ask for something that should trigger a skill (for example, "help me plan this feature" or "let's debug this issue"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant superpowers skill.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## What's Inside

- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow
- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)

**Meta**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success
